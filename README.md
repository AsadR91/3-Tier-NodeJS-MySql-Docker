- Edit user details.
- Delete users.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.
- Smooth animations and minimalistic design.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up this project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.x or higher)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (version 5.7 or higher)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Setting Up MySQL Server

First, you need to set up a MySQL server on your local machine.

1. **Update the package index:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install the MySQL server:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

3. **Log in to the MySQL shell as root:**

   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root
   ```

4. **Set a password for the root user and update the authentication method:**

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

   Replace `'password'` with a secure password of your choice.

5. **Exit the MySQL shell:**

   ```sql
   exit;
   ```

6. **Log in to the MySQL shell again with the new password:**

   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root -p
   ```

   Enter the password you set in the previous step.

7. **Create a new database:**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE test_db;
   ```

8. **Switch to the new database:**

   ```sql
   USE test_db;
   ```

9. **Create the `users` table:**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       role ENUM('Admin', 'User') NOT NULL
   );
   ```

   This table will store user information, including their name, email, and role.

### 2. Configuring and Running the Client

The client side of the application is built using modern JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. To configure and run the client:

1. **Navigate to the client folder:**

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the client application:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This will create a production build of the client application, which will be served by the Express server.

### 3. Configuring and Running the Server

The server side is built using Node.js and Express and connects to the MySQL database to manage user data.

1. **Navigate to the server folder:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Usage

After following the setup instructions, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

### User Management Features:

- **Add User:** Fill in the name, email, and role in the form and click "Add User" to add a new user.
- **View Users:** The user list will be displayed below the form. Each user entry will have "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
- **Edit User:** Click the "Edit" button next to a user entry to update their details.
- **Delete User:** Click the "Delete" button next to a user entry to remove them from the list.

Here‚Äôs a concise article-style write-up with all the commands you used to get the **3-Tier NodeJS + MySQL Docker** app running from cloning to launch:

---

## üöÄ How to Run a 3-Tier NodeJS + MySQL App with Docker Compose

This guide walks through the steps to set up and run a simple 3-tier architecture app using Node.js, MySQL, and Docker Compose.

### üß± Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/AsadR91/3-Tier-NodeJS-MySql-Docker.git
cd 3-Tier-NodeJS-MySql-Docker
```

#### 2. **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose Are Installed**

Verify Docker is installed:

```
docker --version
docker compose version
```

#### 3. **Build and Start the Containers**

This command will build the images (if needed) and start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
docker compose up --build
```

You should see logs from `mysql`, `adminer`, and the `app` services.

#### 4. **Verify Everything Is Working**

* Node.js server runs at: `http://localhost:5000`
* Adminer (DB GUI) is available at: `http://localhost:8080`

  * System: MySQL
  * Server: `mysql`
  * User: `root`
  * Password: `password`
  * Database: `test_db`

#### 5. **Troubleshooting Connection Issues (Optional)**

If you get connection errors:

* Ensure Node.js app is configured to connect to `host: 'mysql'`
* Add health checks in `docker-compose.yml` to delay app start
* Restart everything:

```
docker compose down
docker compose up --build
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Interacting with MySQL in Docker: Commands to Explore the DB

Once your MySQL container is running via Docker Compose, you can interact with it directly from the command line using `docker exec`.

### üîç Step-by-Step MySQL Exploration

#### 1. **Access the MySQL Container**

```
docker exec -it mysql mysql -u root -p
```

Enter the password when prompted:

```
password
```

---

#### 2. **Show All Databases**

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```
OR
```
show databases;
```

Look for your app database (e.g., `test_db`).

---

#### 3. **Use the App‚Äôs Database**

```
USE test_db;
```

---

#### 4. **List All Tables**

```
SHOW TABLES;
```

You should see a table named `users`.

---

#### 5. **View Contents of the `users` Table**

```
SELECT * FROM users;
```

This will return user records that were either seeded or inserted via the Node.js app.
